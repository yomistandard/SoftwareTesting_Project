# üìã 1. Test Plan

### 1.1 Objectives
Verify that:
- Word scrambling algorithm never reveals the original word.
- Scoring system applies correct points (10 for solving directly, 5 when using hints).
- Hint system properly deducts 2 points.
- Game handles empty or malformed inputs gracefully.

| Core game logic            | Browser compatibility beyond Chrome |  
| Word scrambling, hints, scoring | Accessibility features (e.g., screen readers) |  
| UI responsiveness          | Backend server interactions |  

### 1.3 Resources
- **Tester:** Abayomi Abdulafeez  
- **Tools:** Chrome DevTools, JavaScript Console  
- **Test Data:** JSON word bank with 10 words

| Defect Reporting   | 30           | 12:15 - 12:45        |  

### 1.5 Entry/Exit Criteria
| **Phase**          | **Entry Criteria**                   | **Exit Criteria**                     |  
|--------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|  
| Functional Testing | Game loads successfully in Chrome | All critical test cases pass          |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è 2. Risk Analysis

### 2.1 Risk Matrix
| ID  | Feature     | Risk                         | Likelihood | Impact | Priority | Mitigation Strategy                   |  
|-----|-------------|------------------------------|------------|--------|----------|--------------------------------------|  
| R1  | Scoring     | Incorrect point calculation  | Medium     | High   | Critical | Boundary value testing, verify with known inputs |  
| R2  | Input Handling | Malformed or empty input accepted | Low | Medium | Medium | Validate input before processing |  

### 2.2 Risk Coverage
- Focus on high-impact areas like scoring accuracy, hint deduction, and word scrambling.
- Regularly review test outcomes to catch issues early in high-risk features.

## üß™ 3. Test Cases

### 3.1 High-Priority Tests (Risk-Based)

**TC-01: Hint Point Deduction**  
- **Steps:**  
  1. Solve puzzle without hint ‚Üí Score should be 10  
  2. Solve the same puzzle with hint ‚Üí Score should be 8 (deduct 2 points)  
- **Expected:** Score reduces by 2 when hint is used  
- **Actual:** [Your Observation]  
- **Status:** Pass / Fail

**TC-02: Word Scrambling Does Not Reveal Original Word**  
- **Steps:**  
  1. Start a new game  
  2. Observe the scrambled word  
  3. Verify it does not match the original word  
- **Expected:** Scrambled word differs from original  
- **Actual:** [Your Observation]  
- **Status:** Pass / Fail

**TC-03: Load Word Bank Successfully**  
- **Steps:**  
  1. Launch game  
  2. Check if word list is loaded from JSON file  
- **Expected:** Word list loads correctly and displays in UI or console logs  
- **Actual:** [Your Observation]  
- **Status:** Pass / Fail

**TC-04: UI Responsiveness on Mobile**  
- **Steps:**  
  1. Resize browser or test on mobile device/emulator  
  2. Observe layout and functionality  
- **Expected:** UI adjusts and remains usable across device sizes  
- **Actual:** [Your Observation]  
- **Status:** Pass / Fail

**TC-05: Hint System Provides Partial Clues Only**  
- **Steps:**  
  1. Click "Hint" button  
  2. Verify hint provides a partial clue (e.g., first letter or hint phrase)  
- **Expected:** Hint does not reveal entire answer  
- **Actual:** [Your Observation]  
- **Status:** Pass / Fail

## üí≠ 5. Reflection

### 5.1 Test Approach Changes
Risk analysis shifted our focus to testing the scoring and hint features more thoroughly, ensuring critical functionalities are prioritized. It helped us avoid wasting time on low-impact areas.

### 5.2 Coverage vs Time Trade-offs
| **Decision**                     | **Rationale**                                              |  
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|  
| Limited cross-browser testing    | Due to time constraints, we focused on Chrome, covering ~80% of users |  
| Prioritizing high-risk features  | Ensured the most critical areas are validated first |  

### 5.3 Lessons Learned
Early risk assessment allows for targeted testing, reducing time spent on less critical features and increasing bug detection efficiency.
