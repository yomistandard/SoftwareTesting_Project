## Test Plan

### 1. Test Objectives
- Verify the correctness of the word scrambling algorithm (does not reveal the original word)
- Ensure the hint system provides appropriate hints without revealing answers prematurely
- Confirm scoring mechanism accurately calculates points
- Check responsiveness of UI across devices
- Validate JSON word bank loads correctly and contains valid data

### 2. Scope
**In scope:**
- Core game logic (word scrambling, hint system, scoring)
- UI responsiveness
- Word bank loading from JSON

**Out of scope:**
- Browser compatibility beyond Chrome
- Backend server interactions (if any)
- Accessibility compliance
